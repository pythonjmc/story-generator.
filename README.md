# story-generator.
Want a little story to pass the time? But didn't know which book/site to choose? Then execute this code ;) It will propose you a little story at random from a file where all the possible stories are.

I created this little program by myself. I created two different .py files, one called "main" and the other called "stories" in which there is a list in which there are many different stories. I used importlib to import my secondary file to my main.py. The stories in the code were taken from the internet and put in this code to test it, if you want real stories to really use this code then modify the stories and their number.
